Internet

This is an example project of some "better" practices to put in place, such as implementing a light PageObject model using PageFactory for object creation and initialization.  

Currently this project is using Cucumber-JVM and PicoContainer to test Dave Haeffner's "The Internet" at http://the-internet.herokuapp.com.
